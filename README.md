# Personal Card Project
This is my <b>Personal Card</b> project - a digital card where you can find all the important information about me. It's a simple and elegant way to share my professional profile, social links, and contact details in one place.

## What's included:
- <b>About Me</b>: A brief introduction to who am I.
- <b>Skills & Expertise</b>: An overview of my professional skills and areas of expertise.
- <b>Social Media links</b>: Connect with me on platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
- <b>Downloadable Resume</b>: Get a copy of my latest resume directly from the card.   

## Why this project?
I wanted to create a simple, accessible way to showcase my professional journey and make it easy for anyone to connect with me. It's designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and easy to navigate.
